# Klo√ºgle - Freedom from the Cloud

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arugifa/klougle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arugifa/klougle)

**Klo√ºgle** offers you to host, on your own server, a range of services
traditionally provided by web companies like **Google**.

If you care about your privacy, and think that nobody else should be able to
access to your very own secrets, then Klo√ºgle is made for you!


## Overview

Currently, here is what you can expect to find in Klo√ºgle:

- a **note-taking** application ([Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/)),
  like [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) or [Evernote](https://evernote.com/),
- a **news** reader ([Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/)),
  like [Google News](https://news.google.com/) or [Feedly](https://feedly.com/),
- a personal **task management** board ([Kanboard](https://kanboard.org/)),
  like [Trello](https://trello.com/).

That's all? Yep, for now! üòÄ The main focus has been to build Klo√ºgle's
foundations so far. But the following services will be available during the
next few months:

- a **file storage and synchronization** service,
  like [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/),
- a **calendar**, like [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/),
- a **webmail** with [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) support,
  like [Google Mail](https://mail.google.com/) + [Mailvelope](https://www.mailvelope.com/),
- a **contact** management tool, like [Google Contacts](https://contacts.google.com/),
- a **URL shortener**, like [goo.gl](https://goo.gl/).

It is not my goal to reinvent the wheel: by carefully selecting a set of
open-source softwares, Klo√ºgle is able to provide you the simplest and most
user-friendly alternatives to proprietary services.

If you are looking for even more services not yet supported by Klo√ºgle,
have a look to [Framasoft](https://degooglisons-internet.org/en/list/). This
french association, which believes that you should keep the control over your
personal data, provides for free a wide range of Google-like services üòâ


### How Klo√ºgle is different from other self-hosted Cloud solutions?

People shouldn't have to follow any tutorial, in order to know how to deploy
a web service. This knowledge should be contained into some
[Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)
recipes, that everybody would just have to run. Nothing more.

For this purpose, Klo√ºgle does not provide any fancy administration dashboard,
neither a market place. In fact, Klo√ºgle audience is composed of hackers, who
like to keep control over their infrastructure by just editing a set of files.
This makes the whole thing easier to automate, and adapt to everyone need.

Several manual steps still have to be performed, in order to deploy Klo√ºgle,
depending on your running environment. But the goal, over the long-term, is to
make Klo√ºgle the de-facto easy to use, extend, customize and deploy self-hosted
Cloud solution‚Ñ¢.


## Getting Started

### Requirements

#### Software Dependencies

Klo√ºgle depends on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to set-up your server.
This great tool makes possible to deploy Klo√ºgle in many different environments.

**Warning: Klo√ºgle is currently [not compatible](https://github.com/arugifa/klougle/issues/15)
with the latest version of Terraform (0.12), which introduced many major changes**


##### On Linux

Unfortunately, **Terraform** is not yet available on most **Linux** distributions.
If it's your case, you have to install it manually:

```sh
# First, download Terraform.
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.14/terraform_0.11.14_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.11.14_linux_amd64.zip -d /tmp
rm terraform_0.11.14_linux_amd64.zip

# Then, install Terraform on your system.
sudo mv /tmp/terraform /usr/local/bin/
```


##### On macOS

You cannot use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), as you need to install an older
version of Terraform (0.11):

```sh
# First, download Terraform.
curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.14/terraform_0.11.14_darwin_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.11.14_darwin_amd64.zip -d /tmp
rm terraform_0.11.14_darwin_amd64.zip

# Then, install Terraform on your system.
sudo mv /tmp/terraform /usr/local/bin/
```


#### DNS Records

Every service deployed with Klo√ºgle is running on its own sub-domain. Which
means that, you not only have to buy a domain name, but also create address
records for every Klo√ºgle service.

As only a very few services are available for now, it's pretty simple:

- `news.<YOUR_DOMAIN>`
- `tasks.<YOUR_DOMAIN>`

When deploying Klo√ºgle online, **Terraform** will provide you the IP address of
your Klo√ºgle server. So you can update your DNS zone afterwards.

However, if you only want to play with Klo√ºgle locally, then the simplest option
is to update the `/etc/hosts` file of your machine. For example:

```ini
127.0.0.1    news.localhost notes.localhost sync.notes.localhost tasks.localhost
```


### Installing Klo√ºgle

Klo√ºgle is meant to be deployable in many different locations, like cloud
providers or physical servers.

But whatever is your running environment, you first need to download Klo√ºgle on
your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arugifa/klougle.git
cd klougle/
```


#### Locally

When deploying Klo√ºgle locally, you also need to have **Docker** installed.
For Linux systems, please refer to the documentation of your distribution.
For macOS, with **Homebrew**, you can just type: `brew cask install docker`

Then, deploy Klo√ºgle services with **Terraform**:

```sh
cd docker/
terraform init
terraform apply
```

And that's it!


#### On Bare-Metal Servers

When deploying Klo√ºgle remotely, **Terraform** is connecting to the **Docker**
daemon with TLS, for security reasons. That's why you first need to manually
configure the Docker daemon socket to use TLS.

Please refer to the official [Docker guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/)
for more insights. After what, copy the `ca.pem`, `server-cert.pem` and `server-key.pem`
files into `~/.docker/klougle` on your local machine.

Also, you have to choose a **F**ully **Q**ualified **D**omain **N**ame for your server
(if you don't have one yet), update your DNS zone, and finally deploy Klo√ºgle as follows:

```sh
cd docker/
terraform init
terraform apply -var 'host=<SERVER_FQDN>'
```


#### On Cloud Providers

When deployed in the cloud, Klo√ºgle is running inside a virtual machine on
[RancherOS](https://rancher.com/rancher-os/), a minimalist Docker based distribution.

Each cloud provider has different requirements. But for all of them, you will
have to choose a **F**ully **Q**ualified **D**omain **N**ame for your virtual machine.
For example: `cloud.<YOUR_DOMAIN>`

Then, after Klo√ºgle deployment, connecting to your Klo√ºgle server will be as easy as:

```sh
ssh rancher@<SERVER_FQDN>
```

Only [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) providers are supported for now.
The reason is very simple: I am currently the only user of Klo√ºgle, and worked
in the past for a company operating an OpenStack cloud ü§†


##### OpenStack

**Requirements:**

- your **OpenStack RC file**, that you can download from the OpenStack dashboard,
- the **flavor** name you want to use for the server: 1 vCPU and 2048 MB of RAM
  are largely enough,
- all the **key pairs** you want to use to connect to the Klo√ºgle virtual machine:
  the pair associated to the machine where you are running **Terraform** is the
  most important one, of course.

Regarding the network configuration, many scenarios exist.

<a href="http://media.figura.live/klougle/openstack/topology_floating_ip.png">
    <img alt="Klo√ºgle server with floating IP" width="400" src="http://media.figura.live/klougle/openstack/topology_floating_ip.png">
</a>

If your provider lets you accessing to your virtual machines from Internet via
floating IPs, then you have to manually create:

- an **internal network**, to which Klo√ºgle server will connect,
- a **router**, acting as a gateway to the external network (made available by
  your provider).

<a href="http://media.figura.live/klougle/openstack/topology_external_interface.png">
    <img alt="Klo√ºgle server with external interface" width="400" src="http://media.figura.live/klougle/openstack/topology_external_interface.png">
</a>

If your provider allows you instead to attach an interface directly to the
external network, then you don't have anything to do! üôÇ

**Deployment:**

```sh
# First, set-up your OpenStack and SSH environment.
. <OPENRC_FILE>
ssh-add

# Then, deploy your Klo√ºgle server.
cd openstack/
terraform init

# If you use a floating IP pool:
terraform apply -var 'flavor=<FLAVOR_NAME>' -var 'key_pairs=["<PAIR_1>","<PAIR_2>"]' -var 'fqdn=<SERVER_FQDN>' -var 'floating_ip_pool=<POOL_NAME>' -var 'internal_network=<NETWORK_NAME>'

# If you can instead directly connect to the external network:
terraform apply -var 'flavor=<FLAVOR_NAME>' -var 'key_pairs=["<PAIR_1>","<PAIR_2>"]' -var 'fqdn=<SERVER_FQDN>' -var 'external_network=<NETWORK_NAME>'

# Wait a couple of minutes for the server to be up and running, and copy the public IP
# displayed by Terraform. You can now manually assign it to the server FQDN,
# in the DNS zone of your domain.

# After having deployed the Klo√ºgle server,
# it is finally time for deploying Klo√ºgle services with Docker.
cd ../docker/
terraform init
terraform apply -var 'host=<SERVER_FQDN>'
```


## Configuring Klo√ºgle

The only mandatory action you have to perform after installing Klo√ºgle is to
change services' default passwords, or create new users manually.

As Klo√ºgle doesn't provide any central authentication system for the moment:

- every time you want to change your password, you have to do it for all services,
- there is no "Forgot Password" feature yet available, so keep your password(s) safe...

For the following services, you have to create a new user by yourself:

- **notes application:** `http://notes.<YOUR_DOMAIN>/` (please update the server's
  URL when trying to register/sign in with `http://sync.notes.<YOUR_DOMAIN>/`;
  by default, a fake one is used to prevent anyone to create accounts on your
  setup)

But for the following ones, here are the default credentials:

- **news reader:** `admin` / `password` (`http://news.<YOUR_DOMAIN>/settings`)
- **task management:** `admin` / `admin` (`http://tasks.<YOUR_DOMAIN>/user/1/password`)
